# Examination of PDGFR-B reactivity following experimental brain ischemia

This repository contains code notebooks (Quarto and Python) associated with the research on PDGFR-B reactivity following brain ischemia. 


## Folders

Folders are listed in alphabetic order.

**ProData:** Contains processed data sets used for analysis and visualization. These data frames are generated from raw data available at the **RawData** folder, or the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository if the files are too heavy. The precise handling of the data is show in specific notebooks.


## Notebooks

The notebooks are listed according to the suggested execution order to follow the research pipeline described in the research article (XXXXXX)

**Widefield_5x_Shrinkage.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the analysis of brain shrinkage. 

**Widefield_5x_Pdgfrb-IntDen.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the analysis of PDGFR-β integrated density.  

**Widefield_5x_Pdgfrb-LowHigh.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the proportion of reactive (PDGFR-β_high) cells in cortico-striatal lesions.  

**Widefield_5x_Pdgfrb-LowHigh_Str.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the proportion of reactive (PDGFR-β_high) cells in striatal (only regions).  

**Widefield_5x_Gfap-IntDen.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the analysis of GFAP integrated density. 

**Widefield_5x_Gfap-Convex.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the analysis of GFAP convex hull in the ischemic hemisphere. 

## Support files

**.bib files** These are files associated to each notebook containing cited bibliography.
