# Examination of PDGFR-B reactivity following experimental brain ischemia

This repository contains code notebooks (Quarto and Python) associated with the research on PDGFR-B reactivity following brain ischemia. 


## Folders

Folders are listed in alphabetic order.

**ProData:** Contains processed data sets used for analysis and visualization. These data frames are generated from raw data available at the **RawData** folder, or the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository if the files are too heavy. The precise handling of the data is show in specific notebooks.


## Notebooks

The notebooks are listed according to the suggested execution order to follow the research pipeline described in the research article (XXXXXX)

**Widefield_5x_Shrinkage.qmd:** Contains data handling and statistical modeling for the analysis of brain shrinkage. 


## Support files

**.bib files** These are files associated to each notebook containing cited bibliography. 
**science.csl** This files contains the Science Journal citation style implemented in the notebooks. Please note this is style is not associated to the journal the original research artiche is publish in.
